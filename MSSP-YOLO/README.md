# LFMD-YOLO

##### This paper makes the following main contributions:

1. A new mask detection algorithm LFMD-YOLO is proposed. This algorithm features the C3E (CSP Bottleneck with 3 convolutions-ECA) module, the MECAPF (max pooling ECA Pyramid - Fast) module, and the E-BiFPN (ECA-enhanced bidirectional feature pyramid network) module, designed to mine and enrich channel information. Further, by adding a YOLO detection head and improving the intersection over union (IoU), the algorithm
   can fully balance the computational efficiency and accuracy.

2. Two models, LFMD-YOLO and LFMD-YOLO-N, were developed based on model scaling factors, which were
   suitable for different application scenarios respectively. For example, power-constrained edge computing devices, or the cloud and workstations with general-purpose graphics cards.
3. On two public datasets, the LFMD-YOLO method demonstrates its superiority, outperforming several state-ofthe-art algorithms.
